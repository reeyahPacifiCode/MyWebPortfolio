<h1 style= "color: black; text-align: center; font-family: chiller;"><i>OPERA</i></h1>

<p style="color: pink; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;"> <i>Opera</i> refers to a dramatic <i>art form</i>, originating in <i>Europe</i>, in which the emotional content is conveyed to the <i>audience</i> as much through <i>music</i>, both vocal and instrumental, as it is through the <i> lyrics.</i> <p style="color: blue; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;"> By <i>contrast</i>, in musical <i>theater</i> an <i>actor's</i> dramatic <i>performance</i> is primary, and the <i>music</i> plays a lesser <i>role.</i> </p> 
<p style="color: pink; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">The <i>drama</i> in <i>opera</i> is presented using the primary <i>elements</i> of <i>theater</i> such as <i>scenery, costumes, and acting</i>.<p style="color: blue; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">However, the words of the <i>opera, or libretto</i>, are sung rather than spoken. </p> <p style="color: pink; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;"> The <i>singers</i> are accompanied by a musical <i>ensemble</i> ranging from a small instrumental <i>ensemble</i> to a full symphonic <i>orchestra.</i> </p> <br>

<h1 style= "color: black; text-align: center; font-family: chiller;"><i>Dolphin</i> </h1>
<p style="color: pink; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;"> <i>Dolphins</i>are regarded as the friendliest <i>creatures</i> in the <i>sea</i> and <i>stories</i> of them helping drowning <i>sailors</i> have been common since Roman <i>times.</i><p style="color: blue; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">The more we learn about <i>dolphins,</i> the more we realize that their <i>society</i> is more complex than <i>people</i> previously imagined.<p style="color: pink; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">They look after other <i>dolphins</i> when they are ill, care for pregnant <i>mothers</i> and protect the weakest in the <i>community,</i> as we do.<p style="color: blue; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">Some <i>scientists</i> have suggested that <i>dolphins</i> have a <i>language</i> but it is much more probable that they communicate with each other without needing <i>words.</i><p style="color: pink; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">Could any of these <i>mammals</i>be more intelligent than man? Certainly the most common <i>argument</i> in favor of <i>man's superiority</i> over them that we can kill them more easily than they can kill us is the least satisfactory.<p style="color: blue; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">On the contrary, the more we discover about these remarkable <i>creatures,</i>the less we appear superior when we destroy them.

<h1 style= "color: black; text-align: center; font-family: chiller;"> Unsinkable <i>Ship</i></h1>
<p style="color: blue; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;"> Naval <i>architects</i> never claim that a ship is unsinkable, but the sinking of the <i>passenger-and-car 
ferry Estonia</i> in the Baltic surely should have never have happened.<p style="color: pink; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">It was well designed and 
carefully maintained.<p style="color: blue; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">It carried the proper <i>number of lifeboats.</i><p style="color: pink; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">It had been thoroughly inspected 
the day of its fatal <i>voyage.</i><p style="color: blue; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">Yet <i>hours</i> later, the <i>Estonia</i> rolled over and sank in a cold, stormy <i>night.</i><p style="color: pink; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">
It went down so quickly that most of those on <i>board,</i> caught in their <i>dark, flooding cabins,</i> had no 
chance to save themselves: Of those who managed to scramble overboard, only 139 survived.<p style="color: blue; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">
The <i>rest</i> died of <i>hypothermia</i> before the <i>rescuers</i> could pluck them from the <i>cold sea.</i><p style="color: pink; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">The final 
<i>death toll </i>amounted to 912 souls.<p style="color: blue; text-align: center; line-height: 60px;">However, there were an unpleasant number of questions about 
why the <i>Estonia</i> sank and why so many <i>survivors</i> were <i>men</i> in the prime of <i>life,</i> while most of the 
dead were <i>women,</i> <i>children</i> and the <i>elderly.</i>
